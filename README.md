# SimpleGameEngine
A simple 3d game engine based on OpenGL, glfw3 and glew.

This, project is still a work in progress.

A while ago I discovered that this was still a little beyond my current ability. But I decided to leave it here since I intend to return to this project one day and use it to create a 3d game from scratch.

Sometimes improving as a software developer requires us to do things very far outside our comfort zone so we can get an understanding of what it is we don't know so that we can continue to learn.
